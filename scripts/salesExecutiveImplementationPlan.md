   - Validate user session
   - Handle edge cases and errors

### Task 2: Password Reset System
**Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**

1. Create forgot password page:
   - Form with email input
   - Submit handler to call reset API
   - Success/error messaging

2. Create reset password page:
   - Form with password and confirmation
   - Token validation
   - Password update functionality

3. Implement API routes:
   - Forgot password endpoint
   - Reset password endpoint
   - Integration with Better Auth

### Task 3: Search and Filter Enhancement

- Pagination for large sales datasets (future enhancement)

### User Experience
- Loading states for all async operations
