# Role-Based Authentication Implementation Summary

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Default Role Assignment**: New users are automatically assigned the 'executive' role upon registration
✅ **Universal Login Page**: Single login page works for all roles (executive, manager, admin)
✅ **Role-Based Dashboard Redirection**: Users are redirected to their role-specific dashboard after login
✅ **Access Control**: Users cannot access other roles' dashboards
✅ **Dynamic Role Change Redirection**: When a user's role is changed in the database, they are redirected to their new role's dashboard

## Implementation Details

### 1. User Registration
- **File**: `/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`
- **Behavior**: Sets default role to 'executive' in form submission
- **API**: `/api/auth/register/route.ts` defaults role to 'executive' if not provided

### 2. User Authentication
- **File**: `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- **Behavior**: Redirects users to their role-specific dashboard after successful login
- **Redirection Logic**:
  - Executive → `/executive/dashboard`
  - Manager → `/manager/dashboard`
  - Admin → `/admin/dashboard`

### 3. Middleware Access Control
- **File**: `/middleware.ts`
- **Behavior**: 
  - Verifies user session using Better Auth
  - Prevents users from accessing other roles' dashboards
  - Redirects users to their own dashboard when trying to access restricted areas

### 4. Role Change Handling
- **Behavior**: When a user's role is changed in the database (by admin/manager):
  - Next request triggers middleware check
  - User is redirected to their new role's dashboard
  - Access control is enforced based on new role

## Technical Components

### Authentication System
- **Library**: Better Auth
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Session Management**: Built-in Better Auth session handling

### Key Files
1. `/lib/auth.ts` - Better Auth configuration with role support
2. `/lib/auth-client.ts` - Client-side authentication hooks
3. `/models/User.ts` - User schema with role field
4. `/middleware.ts` - Route protection and access control
5. `/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Login with role-based redirection
6. `/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` - Registration with default role

## Testing Verification

All functionality has been verified through:
- Code review of implementation
- Test scripts confirming behavior
- Simulation of role change scenarios
- Access control verification

## Conclusion

The role-based authentication system has been successfully implemented and meets all specified requirements. Users:
- Register with default 'executive' role
- Login through universal page
- Are redirected to appropriate dashboard based on their role
- Cannot access other roles' protected areas
- Get redirected to new role's dashboard when their role changes in the database

The system is secure, functional, and ready for production use.
